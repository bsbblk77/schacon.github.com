# Worth Mentioning

This is the Jekyll source for the blog Worth Mentioning by saLOUt.

It takes usage (is nearly the same) of the blog source from [Schacon](http://github.com/schacon/schacon.github.com), whose blog based on the work of [Mister Bleigh](http://www.mbleigh.com/).

Ater all I also want to copy the copyright section from [Schacon's Blog](http://schacon.github.com/). I hope he doesn't take it amiss.
