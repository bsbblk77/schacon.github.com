title: Call for Konqueror related GSoC 2010 projects
categories:
- kde

I really wonder why there are no Konqueror related idea for a GSoC 2010 project
in the [KDE Community Wiki](http://community.kde.org/GSoC/2010/Ideas).

The last opensuse version ships Firefox as default browser, there are some other
attempts of a kde based browser (rekonq, etc.), but I think that nothing can
replace Konqueror in the next time concerning  consumption of resources.
Konqueror is so fast using pdf viewer KPart Okular while Firefox almost hangs up
with *proprietary* plugin adobe reader. Which other browser can split its view
and show pdf viewer and webpages at the same time? KatePart is also very handy.

I mean it's wrong to think that other Qt based browsers can replace Konqueror in
the next time. Even the inexperienced user wants to use KPart Okular.

However, I use Firefox, because it doesn't use kthml has awesome bookmark tagging
and can be synced with Mozilla Weave. It would be nice to see these features
prospectively integrated in Konqueror, too.

What do you think? Can we bring Konqueror to the next level?
